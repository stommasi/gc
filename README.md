gopher client
=============

This is a very small Linux command-line client for the
[Gopher protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)).
It is currently under development.

To compile, execute the build script: `./build`

Begin the client without arguments to open a default location in Gopherspace.
Navigate by entering the number of the menu item you would like to visit. Type
'u' to go backward through the hierarchy. Documents or menus that are too long
to fit on one screen will display one screen's worth at a time. Move forward by
hitting the spacebar, or type another command to do something else. Quit the
program by typing 'q'.
